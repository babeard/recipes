Add @water{8%cup} to a large #saucepan{} and boil.

Add @polenta{2%cup} (or use grits) to the boiling water slowing while stirring. Turn stove down to low or off and stir occasionally.

When thickened, around ~{3%minutes}, optionally add @butter{2%tbsp}, @black pepper{1%dash} and @salt{1%dash} to taste.

> Hint: You can serve on plates if the polenta is too hot, in order to cool down faster.
